        /*
        Trees:
            A tree is a hierarchical data structure used to organize and represent data in a parent–child relationship.
            It consists of nodes, where the topmost node is called the root, and every other node can have one or more child nodes.

            Root - start node for a tree where it can have internal and leaf nodes.
            Internal Node - it consist of ancestor and child nodes 
            Leaf Node - it is the end node where it does'nt have chid nodes.
            Ancestor - parent of current node 
            Descendent - all the childrens of current node
            Level - From root to leaf node (start from level - 0)
            Height - no of levels.

            Types of Trees:
                a)Binary Tree - Each node can have a maximum of two children.
                    full-binary trees, complete tree, balanced tree.
                    Types of Binary Trees-BST, Binary Index Tree, Balanced Binary Trees
                b)Ternary Tree - Each node can have a maximum of three children - left,middle,right.
                c)N-ary Tree - Each node can have any no of children nodes.
                            duplicates are not allowed
                            n = at max that many child nodes will be generated.
                            eq. b-tree, b+tree, trie.
